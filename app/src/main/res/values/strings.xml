Abstract:\n
Surveillance bot are basically used for security purposes which can work 24X7 and Provide Real World time Information without any delay so any Unusual change can be monitored .\n
Justification :\n
1.In a situation where you want to monitor changes in restricted areas where no one is allowed to go .The bot is programmed to move in a particular trigictor and detect any obstacle in the trigictor which can directly survey a sudden change due to unwanted obstacles in the trajectory.This bot can be handled manually by camera and bluetooth module embedded in it .\n
2. Change in Temperature may be due to a fire ignition to violate any security measures.\n
3.Gas sensor to detect sudden change in atmosphere due gas.May be to violate and Disturb the security measures.\n
Connectivity:\n
The whole Data is monitored in a private web server created by a personal IP of wifi. To monitor the data through a well defined graph.
